        Motivated. Persistent. Focused. I've had a versatile but always focused
        path with the goal of working as a software developer. I took a
        professional computer management course and worked as an intern, as part
        of the program of this course at an accounting firm. I worked part-time
        as a waiter during the 3 years I took to complete my Bachelor's degree
        in Computer Engineering, at ISCTE-IUL. My experiences have ended up
        giving me communication skills in several languages, conflict and time
        management as well as a broad knowledge in computer science. Currently a
        full-stack developer at CGI and studying for a Master's degree in
        Computer Engineering.

        As my first job as a programmer I've contributed to international projects using a variety of technologies.
        I've worked as a full-stack developer meaning that I have experience in both frontend technologies like JavaScript and Angular aswell as backend technologies like Java and C#.
